# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

It took me a bit of getting used to but the videos were helpful to follow along with and looking at the code from the notes I was able to piece together the code.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I'm doing this on the school laptops so it's difficult to work on one monitor the whole time switching back and forth. (I'm saving up for a new computer to be able to run the right software.  I'm working on a tower that's going on 15 years old).  I had trouble putting the steps together and actually navigating the oracle site to read all the usefull information.  I think the oracle site is just a bit overwhelming for me at first with so much to sift through.  I feel that I'm able to read the code just fine after it's all said and done and I was able to trouble shoot the TEST txt files this week better than last and feel more confident on those.  But it took me a longer time than I would've liked to actually look through the code before writing it and find what I needed to include.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

I solved it all from the oracle site and the class lecture site and videos.

# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I was able to navigate the oracle website well and find what I was looking for after watching the videos.  I'm still grasping my head around what the data means that we gathered but I know how to get it and display it now.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

Week 9 I moved on the weekend and tried to get everything done before hand but wasn't able to for this class.  This whole of week 10 I've been playing catch up and workin on unpacking.  A lot of stress from the move and organizing and cleaning so I'm sorry for missing last weeks deadlines.  I should be all caught up by the end of this weekend or by Tuesday at the latest depending on how difficult grasping some of these new concepts will be for me.


#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Just the oracle website and the class website was used for this week.

# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I felt a lot more confident with fixing coading errors and reading the test outputs to make sure i'm getting the correct output.  It just goes to show that the more you do it the more comfortable you become. 

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I'll admit I struggled when it came to fixing the jdoc errors in Lab9.  I was way over thinking it putting in a ton of print lines to see what variables were there just to find out that the order the functions were called in was the problem.  It was a real forehead slapper when I fixed it after so many hours of staring at it all.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

the only thing I used outside of the website and videos was Slack to read where other people were getting stuck in the same spots.

TODO:

1.)	This comment ends up ends up in the version comments sections but it should be above the author in the main statement to show what the whole class is about so the code reader isn't looking further into the code for it.

2.)	Not sure if this is a trick question but the period after to is commented out so it technically does nothing and has no effect on the code itself.

3.)	The HTML tags in the above comments will help format the Javadoc when it's created

4.)	Version is used to show what version is the current version of the file you're using and the Since is to show at what version point you added this method to the code.

5.)	Throws should be used when you're not checking for an exception to begin with

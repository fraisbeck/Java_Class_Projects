# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week?

I think this week went well all around.  There were some obstacles that I had to figure out on my own but overall I think this was a good week.

#### What didn't go so well this week?

At first I didn't know what the jsp file was doing and I tried looking it up on the websites lecture notes but didn't figure it out until I watched the 3rd video about it
Trying to wrap my head around linking the image was also screwing with me but it just took some trial and error to figure the file path

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

I used

tutorialspoint.com/servlets/servlets-hits-counter.htm to figure out how to impliment the hit Counter

I also used

javatpoint.com/java-get-current-date to get the code for displaying the current time and date.

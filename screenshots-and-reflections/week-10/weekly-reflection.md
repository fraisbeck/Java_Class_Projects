# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

It was fairly easy to impliment lab 4 and 5 after following along with the videos. Lab 6 took me forever to comprehend what was going on.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

Trying to wrap my head around how to use expressions and declarations with the ServlerContext. What I didn't understand until AFTER I solved the issue was that you can't call the variable that you created in the jspInit method outside of that method.  But rather use the request method (even though it was declared anywhere like it is in the servlet scripts we've been writing) to call back the context that is saved to the server.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Mainly I used the class website but also the slack help board to bounce ideas around with Jen and Kristin and Ben until all the parts fell into place.

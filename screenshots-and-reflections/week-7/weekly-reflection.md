# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week?

I think things went pretty well this week.  A few road blocks I ran into along the way but it was simple errors like
copy paste scripts that I didn't fully re edit.  

#### What didn't go so well this week?

I didn't really know if Lab 4 came out the way it was supposed too.  The only difference in the print line was that it came out in reverse which I feel isn't much of a change.

I had an issue with the new file runLabsUnit2.sh also not allowing me to run it properly until I changed the file settings to allow me to do so.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

Outside of the class site and videos I used the Jdoc site to learn the methods and classes of each new instance we were using.

# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

This week was fairly simple to just get project 2 setup for labs.  I need to take notes on what to do to switch back and forth between them so I can finish project 1.  I still am having difficulty grasping what I'm missing from the videos and lecture notes on what the final code is supposed to look like.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

There was a lot of downloading and extracting and making sure things were in the proper folder directory that simply following the tasks was simple enough but I needed to go back through it to learn what exactly I actually did outside of just downloading a bunch of files and run tests

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

I just followed the module notes

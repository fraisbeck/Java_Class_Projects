# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

This week was really easy to follow along with.  My previous HTML classes help me better able to read the code that we're using as well so manipulating the home page and editing it to feel more like it belongs with my site was easy to follow along with.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

The only thing that's not going well is the image I placed in isn't set to the css we're running with so my side menu bar is covered on this weeks assignment by it.  But the home page link on the top isn't so you can still navigate back home to it.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All I did was follow the video and read some lecture notes for this week.  No need to look outside of class to complete this one.

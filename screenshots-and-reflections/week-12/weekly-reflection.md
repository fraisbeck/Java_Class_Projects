# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week?

I think a lot went well.  It was a good quick review of SQL from last semester.  It'll take a bit for the java to sink in but I understand how the SQL fits into it.

#### What didn't go so well this week?

It was a bit difficult to copy and paste some of the code at times.  
The screens don't scroll so I had to triple click the last few lines to make sure I didn't miss anything

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

I used tutorialspoint.com to get a commented view of what the code contains and should be laid out like.

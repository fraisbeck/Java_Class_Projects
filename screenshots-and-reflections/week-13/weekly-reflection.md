# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I think this is a great start to putting everything together for this unit and I didn't run into any trouble with getting it all running.

Using the <c:import file="" /> was easy enough to find and replace the include from project 3

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I didn't have any hitches.  I followed the lab and think that everything turned out correctly the first time after following along with the videos
The lab was unclear at first.  I only replaced the template within Unit 4's labs.  I left Unit 3 alone so that it would show that I know how to use both ways 
of adding content from another source.  If you need me to replace every file like this let me know and it shouldn't take me too long to make the change for you.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Just used the class website.  It was fairly straight forward this week.

# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

This project went a lot smoother this time around than the first one.  Not sure if it as because I was working with pre existing
or if it's because I've just been picking up on the new methods more than last project.  But I feel a lot more confident this time around than last


I attempted the Lexical Density analyzer and I feel like I got a good portion of it correct but it's only reading it as 97% of the big file.  So I don't know if the list of words I have isn't long enough or if the file just has that many random words that don't fit into the list.  Either way I feel like I have 80% of it done.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

I did several google searches (I did them a while ago on my other computer so I don't know the exact Url's) but I looked up how to iterate through
a Map set and add 1 to the value based on the key without replacing it and re entering it with the put method.  I also looked up how to continue a properties file
text with multiple lines to still be read as the same one.  Otherwise everything else I found on the class site and videos.

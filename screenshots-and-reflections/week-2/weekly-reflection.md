# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

Following along with the videos helped me a lot.  I've been more of a visual learner and listening to you talk through what we were working on really helped it sink in more. 

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I guess that I missed the download links for the ./runLabs1.sh and the other one last week.  So I went hunting back through the notes and videos to find them for this week.  Just goes to show that you don't always get things right the first time through.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

I finished this lab with just the notes from the site and the videos you've posted

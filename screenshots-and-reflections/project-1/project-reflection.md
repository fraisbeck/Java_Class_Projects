# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

I did not finish this project.  I've been slowly pulling my hair out for the past few days.  I can't seem to wrap my head around this project at all and I've had a few panic attacks.  I feel like i've just been re writing code back and forth between classes trying to figure out how the methods link up to follow the test results and I need a lot of help on this.  

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

Share your resources here. Example: "When completing this project, I used this [stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28177370/how-to-format-localdate-to-string), to format the date.   

I also got stuck with a corrupt commit error message:

			error: inflate: data stream error (incorrect header check)
			error: corrupt loose object '5cdeb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a'
			fatal: loose object 5cdeb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a (stored in .git/objects/5c/deb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a)

Curtis, the IT Guide, helped me resolve it by using [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12571557/fixing-a-corrupt-loose-object-as-a-commit-in-git).

If you didn't use any additional resources or receive any outside help, then indicate that as such. Example: "I did not use any outside resources on any parts of this submission - the work is entirely my own."

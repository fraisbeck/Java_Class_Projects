# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

I did not finish this project.  I've been slowly pulling my hair out for the past few days.  I can't seem to wrap my head around this project at all and I've had a few panic attacks.  I feel like i've just been re writing code back and forth between classes trying to figure out how the methods link up to follow the test results and I need a lot of help on this.

I finally finished it! I couldn't get all the tests working on the two analyzer classes.  It was saying I didn't have a correct input path but everything works properly according to the results the class site and slack said I should get.  I had to delete my whole project at least twice and start from scratch because it just was not clicking with how it all needed to be laid out.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

Outside of the class site and videos I used

to gather the file information for the summary output page.

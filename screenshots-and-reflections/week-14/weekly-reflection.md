# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week?

I think this week went fairly well.  I watched the videos and looked along with the demo example
code given to figure it out piece by piece.

#### What didn't go so well this week?

It took me a little bit to realize that int and Integer are two different types of variables
You can't have a null int but you can have a null Integer.

I'm also not sure if I did the title tag right in the last lab.  I copied over the head.JSP
and modified it to pull the variable I entered to see if that works but the tab still read the
same as my other tabs normally do.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?

I used the class website, the class videos, and the w3schools website to refresh myself on
html forms and syntax
